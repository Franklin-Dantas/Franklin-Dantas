# Copilot / AI Agent Instructions for this repository

## Purpose
This repository is a personal GitHub profile (single-page portfolio). The main content is the README files: `README.md` (Português), `README_us.md` (English), and `README_es.md` (Spanish). There is no source code or tests here — changes are content edits to markdown, assets, and workflow configuration.

## Quick orientation (what matters)
- Primary files to edit:
  - `README.md` — canonical Portuguese profile
  - `README_us.md`, `README_es.md` — localized copies; keep them in sync when changing content
  - `snake.yml` — GitHub Actions workflow that generates the "snake" contribution animation and publishes `dist/` to the `output` branch
- CI: `snake.yml` uses `Platane/snk@v3` to produce SVG/GIF outputs and `crazy-max/ghaction-github-pages@v4` to push `dist/` to `output` branch.
- Visual assets and badges are mostly external (e.g., `shields.io`, `capsule-render.vercel.app`). Avoid committing large binaries — prefer external hosting.

## Common tasks & examples ✅
- Local preview of README changes
  - Use VS Code: open the file and run **"Open Preview to the Side"** or `Ctrl+K V` to ensure markdown renders correctly.
  - For visual checks, create a small PR and view on GitHub (exact rendering may differ slightly from VS Code).

- Update the snake animation
  - Edit `snake.yml` to adjust palettes or outputs. The workflow supports manual runs via `workflow_dispatch` and runs on a schedule/push to `main`.
  - Output files are written to `dist/` and published to the `output` branch. Don't manually edit `output` unless needed — prefer updating `snake.yml` and letting the action push.

- Adding or editing badges and images
  - Follow the existing pattern using `img.shields.io` and external CDN links. Keep color/theme consistent (purple/dark palette used throughout).
  - Prefer small SVGs or CDN-hosted images to keep repo lightweight.

## Editing conventions / style notes
- Keep localized README variants synchronized: when you change `README.md`, replicate the change in `README_us.md` and `README_es.md` (translate text rather than overwriting with auto-generated content).
- Code blocks use language-specific fences (```js, ```yaml, etc.) — keep that pattern when adding examples.
- Maintain the top-of-file structure: header and banner images at top (capsule-render and shield badges) — keep spacing and banner sizes consistent.

## Where to run checks
- There are no automated tests in this repository. Validate changes visually in VS Code (Markdown Preview) and via GitHub PR preview.
- To trigger the snake workflow manually: GitHub Actions → "Generate Snake Animation" → Run workflow (or push to `main`). The workflow writes to `dist/` and is published to `output` branch.

## Quick do / don't
- Do: update all localized READMEs when changing content; use external image hosting for large assets; keep PRs small and descriptive.
- Don't: commit large binaries or edit the `output` branch directly (it is generated by CI).

## Contact / Context
- If unsure about copy/translation choices or updating badges, open an issue or tag @Franklin-Dantas in the PR for review.
